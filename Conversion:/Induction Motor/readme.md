>If it's 3450 RPM, it's a two pole motor. If it's 1725 RPM it's a four pole motor.

>But you can make it an induction generator without modifying it. You place a 10-20uF AC capacitor across the winding for each horsepower. (So a 2 horsepower motor would need a 20-40uF AC oil capacitor). You get it spinning synchronous speed (1800 or 3600 RPM). Then you apply 12-50 VDC to the output terminals momentarily. AC voltage will appear. Under load, you shall increase shaft speed 5% above synchronous speed.

>The generator will produce nameplate current. It will be short-circuit proof (voltage collapses under overload conditions, requiring another DC starting pulse). Induction generators aren't good for starting inductive loads.
